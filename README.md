- Hi, I’m @Philosolis
- I’m interested in writing **in Chinese** (My English is poor, man)
- I’m currently learning computer science and how to live.
- I’m looking to collaborate on writing, yet someone said writing is a lonely work. But I would like to just share my works and I welcome your ideas. I'm planning a public repo of my works. Maybe under CC0.
- How to reach me: wangchh4@shanghaitech.edu.cn
